# MIDI Generator with Transformers
##### Using Machine Learning and Transformers in Python to generate classical music MIDI files.

This is currently a work in progress (WIP) of the music generator. 
As of now, I am still trying to create a MIDI to numpy array convertor.

As this project is currently unfinished, the repository will be a highly changing and active.
If you have any solutions to issues that occur within the code, please request a merge request.
Thanks! 

The MIDI files were extracted from: https://www.bachcentral.com/midiindexcomplete.html.
